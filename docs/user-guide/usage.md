### Once everything is set up

By default, `scalac-profiling` generates the _graph representation_ of the 
implicit searches happening during compilation, and optionally of the macro 
expansions separately by enabling proper compiler plugin option 
(check the available [compiler plugin options](installation.md)). 
To be more precise, the compiler plugin does not generate the graphs for you; instead, 
it persists the graph data in a format that allows you to generate the graphs yourself 
without touching or transforming the data. That graph data is present under the 
_profiledb META-INF directory_, located in the _classes_ directory. For example, 
a flamegraph data file will be located at 
`/target/scala-2.13/classes/META-INF/profiledb/graphs/implicit-searches-X.flamegraph`.

The resulting graphs are obtained by using the [FlameGraph][flamegraph] tool. 
They are intuitive to inspect and browse, and stand out because:

* They allow you to selectively choose what things to profile. Click on every
  stack to zoom in, and reset by clicking "Reset zoom" on the bottom left.
* They allow you to search via regexes and those matching stacks are
  highlighted. Check the search button on the top right.

### Lastly, how to generate a flamegraph?

In order to generate flamegraphs, clone the [scalac-profiling][scalac-profiling]
GitHub repository. The repository contains the `FlameGraph` git submodule consisting 
of the tools to generate the SVG files that you will later use. Once the prepared 
data is generated by the compiler plugin (`.flamegraph` file): 

1. `cd` into the `external/Flamegraph` directory;
2. Execute the `git submodule update --init`;
3. And run the following command in the `FlameGraph` project's root directory:
```bash
./flamegraph.pl \
    --hash --countname="Î¼s" \
    --color=scala-compilation \
    $PATH_TO_FLAMEGRAPH_DATA > implicit-searches-graph.svg
```

The resulting graph will look like this one we generated for the [Scala Steward][scala-steward] project:

<p>
  <object data="/scalac-profiling/img/scala-steward-implicit-searches-flamegraph.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="100%" height="100%">
  <img src="/scalac-profiling/img/scala-steward-implicit-searches-flamegraph.svg" width="100%" height="100%" />
  </object>
<p>

### Reading the graphs

A graph is a set of nodes and edges. A node represents an implicit search for a given type. 
Every node specifies how many implicit searches have been triggered in total, 
and how long they took in total. An edge represents the dependency between 
an implicit search and another one.

> It is important to note that every node in a program can be relied upon by other nodes 
> and can serve as the starting point for an implicit search. Therefore, the number of times a
> node has been searched for may not always be equal to the total number of nodes that depend on it.
